# Files
* `fullstate_0.txt` and `fullstate_1.txt` are outputs from `agent2d/src/sample_player.cpp` (CTRL+F 'tongcharlie').
* `fullstate_0_pos.txt` and `fullstate_1_pos.txt` are the extracted positions.
* `pos.py` is a script to count the frequency of the positions.

# Findings
* `fullstate_{0,1}.txt` were generated by `./start.sh -t agent2d 2> fullstate_{0,1}.txt`.
* Obviously they correspond to the server without and with the `fullstate_{l,r}` flags set.
* Because 11 player threads output to stderr at the same time, `fullstate_{0,1}.txt` is noisy. This is why we use `pos.py` to determine the 'actual' output.
* We determine that without fullstate, there is noise in the observed player locations, and they are incomplete (not all 11 teammates are in the world view).
* With fullstate, the positions are noiseless and always visible.
